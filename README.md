# Klarigi Paper Evaluation

Welcome to the repository for the Klarigi paper evaluation. There is a subdirectory for each of the experiments, each of which contains its own README.md with instructions on how to run the experiment, along with some other useful information.

The results were checked as reproducible using Klarigi version [0.1.2](https://github.com/reality/klarigi/releases/tag/0.1.2). with-p output is 0.1.1, but non-p versions were checked with 0.1.2 to ensure no output changes from 0.1.1.
